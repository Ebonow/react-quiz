## Comments 

This was a lot of fun and really enjoyed playing with the transitions. It did not seem necessary to use redux/flux at first, but then saw how I could expand it and would have redone it using a store for state management in hindsight.

I ran into some issues parsing the single quote tick from the json files and will do some more research and how to properly decode the json text.
